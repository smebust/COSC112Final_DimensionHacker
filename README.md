# COSC112Final_DimensionHacker
Multilevel platformer, changes perspective to incorporate gravity.

This project is from December 2018.

Created by Sean Mebust, Jack Fergus, and Brandon Wang as the final project assignment for COSC112 Intro to Computer Science II. All files were written from scratch by this team, and images were pulled from online to be used as characters/sprites.

To run our game, the user needs to compile all the files in terminal.  Running Game.java in terminal will start the game.  The game will take in .png files to draw the images of enemies and the player onto the screen.  Users can move the player using w, a, s, d controls in the platform portion of the game.  The player needs to collect all 3 computer items to advance past the first 3 levels.  If a player comes into contact with any enemy, or with any wall, he will be sent back to the start of the level. Updates on the players progress through the game will be printed out in Terminal. Once the player has collected all 3 items, he will be able to advance on to the final level.  This level transforms the game from a platformer into a side-scroller, implementing gravity.  The player can move left and right using a and d and can jump using w.  Once he reaches the other side of this level, he wins the game.
