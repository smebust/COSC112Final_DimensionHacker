# COSC112Final_DimensionHacker
Multilevel platformer, changes perspective to incorporate gravity.

Created by Sean Mebust, Jack Fergus, and Brandon Wang as the final project assignment for COSC112 Intro to Computer Science II. All files were written from scratch by this team, and images were pulled from online to be used as characters/sprites.
